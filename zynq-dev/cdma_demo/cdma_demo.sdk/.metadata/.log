On error detection, the CURDESC_PNTR register is updated to reflect the descriptor associated with the detected error.
The register should only be written by the software application when the AXI CDMA is idle (CDMASR.IDLE = 1). Descriptor addresses written to this field must be aligned to 64-byte boundaries (sixteen 32-bit words).
Examples are 0x00, 0x40, 0x80. Any other alignment has undefined results.
This register is cleared when CDMACR.SGMode = 0.

If DRE is not included in the AXI CDMA or the data width is 128 or 256 bits, then the address offset of the Destination address must match that of the Source Address register value. Offset is defined as that portion of a system address that is used to designate a byte position within a single data beat width. For example, a 32-bit data bus has four addressable byte positions within a single data beat (0, 1, 2, and 3). The portion of the address that designates these positions is the offset. The number of address bits used for the offset varies with the transfer bus data width.
