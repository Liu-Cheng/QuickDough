This program is used to generate DFG of a partially unrolled loop.
Although the loop is part of the matrix multiplication, the unrolled part
instead of the whole matrix multiplication is verified. Basically, it is
just another fully unrolled loop, and it is just that the unrolled loop is
not the whole matrix multiplication.
