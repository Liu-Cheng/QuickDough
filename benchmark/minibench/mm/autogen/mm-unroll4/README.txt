In this DFG generation program, we are supposed to fully unroll the inner most loop while partially unroll the second loop.
In other words, we assume that one of the input matrix is fully stored while the second input matrix is partially buffered.
However, this situation doesn't appear in this benchmark suit and we haven't finish it yet.
