% Genetic Algorithm Workload Matlab Function 
%
% function w = genalgWorkload(id)
%
%  Calculates the workload given the identifier for a genetic
%  algorithm datafile.  The workload is expressed in number of
%  floating point operations (flops).
%
%  This function works properly ONLY if run within the genalg
%  subdirectory (i.e. the location of this file is matlab's current
%  working directory).
%
%  Parameters:
%   id - identifier representing which dataset to use; the id read
%        will be of the same form as generated by genalgGenerator,
%        i.e. "<id>-genalg-param.dat".
%
%  Input files:
%   data/<id>-genalg-param.dat - the parameters for dataset <id>
%                                (generated by genalgGenerator()).
