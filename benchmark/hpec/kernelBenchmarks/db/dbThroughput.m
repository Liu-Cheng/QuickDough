% Database Throughput Matlab Function 
%
% function t = dbThroughput(id)
%
%  Calculates the throughput given the identifier for a database
%  datafile.  The throughput is expressed in number of
%  transactions per second, a transaction being one database
%  operation (search, insert, or delete).
%
%  Parameters:
%   id - number representing which dataset to use; the file read
%        will be of the same form as generated by DbGenerator and Db,
%        i.e. "<id>-db-param.dat" and "<id>-db-timing.dat".
%
%  Input files:
%   data/<id>-db-timing.dat - the timing data (generated by db).
%   Any files needed by dbWorkload().

         id '" to generate timings for this dataset.']);

% Read in the datafile
