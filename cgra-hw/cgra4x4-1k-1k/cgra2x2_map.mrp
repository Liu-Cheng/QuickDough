    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           558 out of   6,341    8%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   4

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "Clk" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "Clk" is not constrained (LOC) to a specific
   location.
WARNING:Pack:2912 - The LUT-1 inverter "BramIF/Port0_Rst1_INV_0" failed to join
   the "OLOGICE2" comp matched to output buffer "Port1_Rst_OBUF".  This may
   result in suboptimal timing.  The LUT-1 inverter BramIF/Port0_Rst1_INV_0
   drives multiple loads.
WARNING:Pack:2912 - The LUT-1 inverter "BramIF/Port0_Rst1_INV_0" failed to join
   the "OLOGICE2" comp matched to output buffer "Port0_Rst_OBUF".  This may
   result in suboptimal timing.  The LUT-1 inverter BramIF/Port0_Rst1_INV_0
   drives multiple loads.

INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 145 block(s) removed
  46 block(s) optimized away
 666 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
