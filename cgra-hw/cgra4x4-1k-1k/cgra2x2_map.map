ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

        Number using O6 output only:             4
        Number using O5 output only:             0
        Number using O5 and O6:                 32
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        6,341
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           558 out of   6,341    8%
    Number with an unused LUT:               3,393 out of   6,341   53%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       2,390 out of   6,341   37%
    Number of unique control sets:               9
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              21 out of 106,400    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
